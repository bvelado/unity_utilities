## Play from first scene in build
This has been created to avoid closing your working scene(s) to open the startup scene - the one with the 0 build index in your build settings - just for entering playmode.  
It will automatically load the first scene, enter playmode, then when you're finished with your tests or whatever, reload the scenes you were working on.
